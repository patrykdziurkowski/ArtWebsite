# Installing the tool
To use the image tagging feature, do the following:
1. Ensure recognize-anything is cloned into this folder:
`git clone https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything.git`.
2. From its README download the pretrained checkpoint `ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth` into the `recognize-anything/pretrained` folder.
3. Run the app manually or run the tests to confirm the tagging feature works.
